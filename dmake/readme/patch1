dmake Version 3.8 Patch #1
==========================

Nature:  This patch fixes the anoying problem with POSIX_NAME_MAX and NAME_MAX
-------  incompatibility that I introduced with version 3.8.  I hope this
	 makes all of the problems go away.  I may have gotten it wrong for
	 some systems (mac, atari, os2) if so then please let me know and
	 I shall add the fix.

Availability:

=============== Summary of fixes =============================================
- For Coherent version of dmake, added the equivalent of

     #define void int 

  through the use of -D command line flag.

- Minor tweaks to the control-C handling under MSDOS, it should now terminate
  more quickly and deliver correct error codes back to dmake.

- replaced the use of _POSIX_NAME_MAX as the file component length to,
  NAME_MAX, this should greatly enhance portability as I have supplied
  NAME_MAX definitions for those OS's that don't potentially have it already.
  (bloody braindamage here folks)

- Deleted the file unix/explode.c.  The code there is no longer used and
  should not have been distributed (blush).  Oh well, dese tings do 'appen!

- Deleted the use of #elif define(blah) to satisfy broken compilers.

- Added a 'limits.h' file to unix/bsd43 (it's blank, normal distributions of
  BSD43 don't come with this file)

- Compiles and works using gcc under Sun OS 4.1.1, hopefully now works elsewhere
  using gcc as well.  Let me know of problems you may come accross.

- Changed Sun tempnam.c code to make sure we don't write to a static string.
  Also fixed a call to Closefile() in state.c to not pass any parameters.

- Added -X flag to allow users to suppress execution of #! line at start of
  makefile.

- Fixed arlib.c for 386i boxes, it now correctly sets PORTAR prior to
  including <ar.h>.

- Cleaned up output of dmake -h a little.
